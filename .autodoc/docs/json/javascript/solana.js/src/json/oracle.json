  "summary": "The `OracleJson` class in this code is responsible for handling the creation and management of oracle objects within the `sbv2-solana` project. An oracle is a data provider that supplies external information to a blockchain, and this class defines the properties and methods needed to interact with oracles in the project.\n\nThe class implements the `CreateQueueOracleParams` interface, which ensures that the required properties for creating an oracle are present. These properties include the oracle's name, metadata, stake amount, permission status, and associated keypairs for authority and staking wallet.\n\nThe constructor of the `OracleJson` class takes an object as input and initializes the properties using utility functions like `parseString`, `parseNumber`, and `parseBoolean`. These functions help in parsing the input object and assigning default values if the properties are not present.\n\nThe `loadMultiple` static method is used to create an array of `OracleJson` instances from an input object containing an array of oracles. This method is useful when working with multiple oracles at once, as it simplifies the process of creating and managing multiple instances.\n\nThe `toJSON` method returns a JSON representation of the `OracleJson` instance, which can be used for serialization or storage purposes. This method includes the conversion of keypairs to strings using the `keypairToString` utility function.\n\nIn the larger project, the `OracleJson` class can be used to create, manage, and interact with oracles. For example, when creating a new oracle, an instance of this class can be created with the required parameters, and then the instance can be used to interact with the oracle on the Solana blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `OracleJson` class and how does it relate to the `CreateQueueOracleParams` interface?**\n\n   The `OracleJson` class is used to represent and manipulate oracle data in JSON format. It implements the `CreateQueueOracleParams` interface, which means it should contain all the properties and methods defined in that interface.\n\n2. **How are the `authority` and `stakingWalletKeypair` properties initialized in the `OracleJson` constructor?**\n\n   The `authority` property is initialized by calling the `loadKeypair` function with the `authorityPath` value, which is obtained by parsing the input object. If the `authorityPath` is not provided, the `authority` property will be set to `undefined`. The `stakingWalletKeypair` property is initialized by calling the `loadKeypair` function with the `stakingWalletPath` value, which is also obtained by parsing the input object. If the `stakingWalletPath` is not provided, a new keypair is generated using the `Keypair.generate()` method.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `loadMultiple` static method in the `OracleJson` class?**\n\n   The `loadMultiple` static method is used to create an array of `OracleJson` instances from an input object containing an array of oracle data. It checks if the input object has an `oracles` property and if it is an array, then it iterates through the array and creates a new `OracleJson` instance for each oracle data object, adding it to the `oracleJsons` array. The method returns the `oracleJsons` array containing all the created `OracleJson` instances."
