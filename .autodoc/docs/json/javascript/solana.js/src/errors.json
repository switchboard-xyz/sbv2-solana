  "summary": "This code defines a set of custom error classes for the `sbv2-solana` project. These error classes are designed to handle specific error scenarios that may occur during the execution of the project. By creating custom error classes, developers can provide more informative error messages and handle errors more effectively.\n\nSome of the custom error classes defined in this code are:\n\n1. `SwitchboardProgramIsBrowserError`: Thrown when the SwitchboardProgram attempts to sign and submit transactions from a browser environment, which is not supported.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new SwitchboardProgramIsBrowserError();\n```\n\n2. `SwitchboardProgramReadOnlyError`: Thrown when the SwitchboardProgram is in read-only mode and no keypair was provided.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new SwitchboardProgramReadOnlyError();\n```\n\n3. `ExistingKeypair`: Thrown when a provided keypair corresponds to an existing account.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new ExistingKeypair();\n```\n\n4. `AccountNotFoundError`: Thrown when an account with a specified label and public key is not found.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new AccountNotFoundError(\"AccountLabel\", publicKey);\n```\n\n5. `InstructionsPackingError`: Thrown when instruction groups do not fit into a single transaction.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new InstructionsPackingError();\n```\n\n6. `NativeMintOnlyError`: Thrown when wrap/unwrap operations are called on a non-native mint.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new NativeMintOnlyError();\n```\n\n7. `InsufficientFundsError`: Thrown when there are insufficient funds to perform an action.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new InsufficientFundsError(required, current);\n```\n\n8. `TransactionOverflowError` and its subclasses: Thrown when a transaction exceeds the allowed limits for instructions, accounts, or serialized size.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new TransactionInstructionOverflowError(numInstructions);\nthrow new TransactionAccountOverflowError(numAccounts);\nthrow new TransactionSerializationOverflowError(numBytes);\n```\n\n9. `TransactionMissingSignerError`: Thrown when a transaction is missing required signers.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new TransactionMissingSignerError(signers);\n```\n\n10. `IncorrectAuthority` and `IncorrectOwner`: Thrown when an incorrect authority or owner is provided.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new IncorrectAuthority(expectedAuthority, receivedAuthority);\nthrow new IncorrectOwner(expectedOwner, receivedOwner);\n```\n\n11. `AggregatorConfigError`: Thrown when there is an issue with the aggregator configuration.\n\n```javascript\nthrow new AggregatorConfigError(property, message);\n```\n\nThese custom error classes can be used throughout the `sbv2-solana` project to handle specific error scenarios and provide more informative error messages to developers and users.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method in each custom error class?\n   **Answer**: The `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method is used to set the prototype of the custom error class to the prototype of the parent Error class. This ensures that the custom error class inherits the properties and methods of the parent Error class.\n\n2. **Question**: What is the difference between `TransactionInstructionOverflowError`, `TransactionAccountOverflowError`, and `TransactionSerializationOverflowError`?\n   **Answer**: These are custom error classes that inherit from `TransactionOverflowError`. `TransactionInstructionOverflowError` is thrown when the number of instructions in a transaction exceeds the allowed limit. `TransactionAccountOverflowError` is thrown when the number of accounts in a transaction exceeds the allowed limit. `TransactionSerializationOverflowError` is thrown when the serialized transaction size exceeds the allowed limit.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `IncorrectAuthority` and `IncorrectOwner` custom error classes?\n   **Answer**: The `IncorrectAuthority` custom error class is used to throw an error when an expected authority does not match the received authority. Similarly, the `IncorrectOwner` custom error class is used to throw an error when an expected account owner does not match the received account owner. These error classes help in identifying and handling cases where there is a mismatch in authorities or account owners."
