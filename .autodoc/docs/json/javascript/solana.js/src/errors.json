  "summary": "This code defines a set of custom error classes for the `sbv2-solana` project. These error classes are designed to handle specific error scenarios that may occur during the execution of the project. By creating custom error classes, developers can provide more informative error messages and handle errors more effectively.\n\nSome of the custom error classes defined in this code are:\n\n- `SwitchboardProgramIsBrowserError`: Thrown when the SwitchboardProgram attempts to sign and submit from a browser, which is not supported.\n- `SwitchboardProgramReadOnlyError`: Thrown when the SwitchboardProgram is in read-only mode and no keypair was provided.\n- `ExistingKeypair`: Thrown when a provided keypair corresponds to an existing account.\n- `AccountNotFoundError`: Thrown when an account with a specified label and public key is not found.\n- `InstructionsPackingError`: Thrown when each instruction group does not fit into a single transaction.\n- `NativeMintOnlyError`: Thrown when Wrap/Unwrap is called on a non-native mint.\n- `InsufficientFundsError`: Thrown when there are insufficient funds to perform an action.\n- `TransactionOverflowError`: Thrown when a transaction overflows, with subclasses for specific overflow scenarios:\n  - `TransactionInstructionOverflowError`: Thrown when the number of instructions exceeds the limit.\n  - `TransactionAccountOverflowError`: Thrown when the number of accounts exceeds the limit.\n  - `TransactionSerializationOverflowError`: Thrown when the serialized transaction size exceeds the limit.\n- `TransactionMissingSignerError`: Thrown when a transaction is missing required signers.\n- `IncorrectAuthority`: Thrown when an incorrect authority is provided.\n- `AggregatorConfigError`: Thrown when there is an issue with the aggregator configuration.\n- `IncorrectOwner`: Thrown when an incorrect account owner is provided.\n\nThese custom error classes can be used throughout the `sbv2-solana` project to handle specific error scenarios and provide more informative error messages to developers and users. For example, when creating a new account, the code may check if the provided keypair already exists and throw an `ExistingKeypair` error if it does.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method in each custom error class?\n   **Answer**: The `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method is used to set the prototype of the custom error class to the prototype of the parent Error class. This ensures that the custom error class inherits the properties and methods of the parent Error class.\n\n2. **Question**: What is the difference between the `TransactionOverflowError` and its derived classes (`TransactionInstructionOverflowError`, `TransactionAccountOverflowError`, and `TransactionSerializationOverflowError`)?\n   **Answer**: The `TransactionOverflowError` is a base error class for transaction-related overflow issues. Its derived classes provide more specific error messages for different types of transaction overflow issues: `TransactionInstructionOverflowError` for exceeding the number of instructions, `TransactionAccountOverflowError` for exceeding the number of accounts, and `TransactionSerializationOverflowError` for exceeding the serialized transaction size.\n\n3. **Question**: How are the custom error classes like `AccountNotFoundError` and `IncorrectAuthority` used in the context of the `sbv2-solana` project?\n   **Answer**: These custom error classes are used to provide more specific and informative error messages when certain conditions are not met or errors occur within the `sbv2-solana` project. By using these custom error classes, developers can easily identify and handle specific issues related to accounts, authorities, and other aspects of the project."
