The code in this file is primarily focused on testing the functionality of the `TransactionObject` class and its related methods in the `sbv2-solana` project. The `TransactionObject` class is used to create, manipulate, and send transactions on the Solana blockchain.

The file starts by importing necessary modules and setting up utility functions for testing. The utility functions include `getNonceAccount`, `getNonceIxn`, `getNonceInfo`, and `createDummyIxn`. These functions are used to create and manage nonce accounts, generate transaction instructions, and create dummy instructions for testing purposes.

The main part of the code consists of a series of tests within the `describe('TransactionObject Tests', () => { ... })` block. These tests cover various aspects of the `TransactionObject` class, such as:

1. Comparing two instructions for equality using the `ixnsEqual` function.
2. Testing the behavior of adding a duplicate nonce instruction to a transaction object.
3. Creating a transaction object with options, such as enabling durable nonce, setting compute unit limit, and setting compute unit price.
4. Testing the behavior of creating a transaction object that is too large.
5. Packing transactions with options, such as setting compute unit limit and compute unit price.
6. Packing transactions and adding pre- and post-instructions to each new transaction.

These tests ensure that the `TransactionObject` class and its related methods work as expected, allowing developers to build and interact with the Solana blockchain effectively.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `getNonceAccount` function and how does it handle the case when the `nonceInfoResponse.value` is null?
   **Answer:** The `getNonceAccount` function is used to fetch the NonceAccount information for a given public key from the connection. If the `nonceInfoResponse.value` is null, it means that the NonceAccount was not found, and the function throws an error with the message "NonceAccount not found".

2. **Question:** How does the `createDummyIxn` function work and what are its use cases in the tests?
   **Answer:** The `createDummyIxn` function creates a dummy TransactionInstruction with a specified number of keys (`numKeys`) and an optional data length (`dataLen`). It is used in the tests to create TransactionInstructions with specific properties for testing purposes, such as checking if the TransactionObject can handle different sizes and combinations of instructions.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `TransactionObject.pack` function and how does it handle the packing of transactions with options?
   **Answer:** The `TransactionObject.pack` function is used to pack an array of TransactionObjects into a new array of TransactionObjects, taking into account the provided options such as `computeUnitLimit`, `computeUnitPrice`, and `enableDurableNonce`. It adds the necessary instructions for these options to each packed transaction, ensuring that the resulting transactions adhere to the specified options.
