This code is part of a test suite for the sbv2-solana project, specifically focusing on testing the functionality of the Crank V2 system. The Crank V2 system is responsible for managing and updating a set of data feeds (aggregators) on the Solana blockchain. The tests in this file ensure that the Crank V2 system behaves as expected when creating, updating, and managing these data feeds.

The test suite begins by setting up a test context (`ctx`) and creating a queue account with a specified authority. It then creates two oracles and associates them with the queue account. The test suite consists of several test cases:

1. **Creates a Crank**: This test case ensures that a new Crank account can be created with a specified maximum number of rows (feeds).
2. **Adds a set of feeds to the crank**: This test case creates a set of aggregator accounts (feeds) and adds them to the Crank account. It verifies that the Crank account contains the correct number of feeds after the addition.
3. **Fails to push a non-permitted aggregator onto the crank**: This test case ensures that an aggregator without the proper permissions cannot be added to the Crank account.
4. **Fails to push a new aggregator onto a full crank**: This test case ensures that an aggregator cannot be added to a Crank account that has reached its maximum capacity.
5. **Crank pop tests**: This test case checks the functionality of popping (updating) the data feeds in the Crank account. It verifies that the correct number of feeds are updated and that the Crank turner is rewarded appropriately for their work.

These tests help ensure that the Crank V2 system in the sbv2-solana project functions correctly and can be used to manage and update data feeds on the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CRANK_SIZE` and `QUEUE_REWARD` constants in this code?
   **Answer**: `CRANK_SIZE` is the maximum number of feeds that can be added to the crank, and `QUEUE_REWARD` is the reward amount for each successful crank operation, given in SOL tokens.

2. **Question**: How does the `createCrank` function work, and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `createCrank` function is used to create a new Crank account with a specified name and maximum number of rows (feeds). It takes an object with two properties: `name`, which is a string representing the name of the crank, and `maxRows`, which is a number representing the maximum number of rows (feeds) the crank can hold.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `packedTxns` variable in the 'Crank pop tests' section, and how is it used?
   **Answer**: `packedTxns` is an array of packed transactions created by the `packAndPopInstructionsV2` function. These transactions are used to update the crank and reward the user for successfully turning the crank. The transactions are then signed and sent using the `signAndSendAll` function.
