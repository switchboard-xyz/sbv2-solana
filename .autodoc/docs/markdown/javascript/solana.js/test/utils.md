This code is a utility module for the `sbv2-solana` project, providing helper functions and interfaces for setting up a test environment, creating feeds, and managing the Switchboard program on the Solana blockchain. The code imports necessary dependencies and defines types, functions, and interfaces to interact with the Solana blockchain and the Switchboard program.

The `TestContext` interface is defined to store the context of the test environment, including the cluster, program, payer, and utility functions. The `isLocalnet()` function checks if the environment is set to use a local Solana network. The `getCluster()` function returns the Solana cluster to be used based on the environment variables. The `getProgramId()` function returns the Switchboard program ID based on the cluster. The `getRpcUrl()` function returns the RPC URL for the Solana cluster.

The `setupTest()` function sets up the test environment by initializing the Switchboard program, loading the payer's keypair, and requesting an airdrop if the payer's balance is low. It also checks if the program state account exists and creates it if necessary.

The `createFeed()` function creates a new aggregator feed for a given queue account with optional configurations. The `createFeeds()` function creates multiple aggregator feeds for a given queue account with optional configurations.

These utility functions can be used in the larger project to set up a test environment, create and manage aggregator feeds, and interact with the Switchboard program on the Solana blockchain. For example, the `setupTest()` function can be used to initialize the test environment before running tests, and the `createFeed()` function can be used to create a new aggregator feed for testing purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `isLocalnet()` function and how does it determine if the current environment is a localnet?
   **Answer**: The `isLocalnet()` function checks if the current environment is a localnet (local development environment) by looking at the `SOLANA_LOCALNET` environment variable. If the variable is set to '1', 'true', or 'localnet', the function returns true, indicating that the environment is a localnet.

2. **Question**: How does the `getProgramId()` function determine the correct program ID based on the given Solana cluster?
   **Answer**: The `getProgramId()` function first checks if the `SWITCHBOARD_PROGRAM_ID` environment variable is set. If it is, it returns the program ID from the environment variable. If not, it checks the given Solana cluster and returns the appropriate program ID based on the cluster (either `SBV2_MAINNET_PID` for mainnet-beta or `SBV2_DEVNET_PID` for devnet).

3. **Question**: How does the `createFeeds()` function work, and what are the parameters it accepts?
   **Answer**: The `createFeeds()` function creates multiple aggregator accounts (feeds) for a given queue account. It accepts a queue account, the number of feeds to create (`numFeeds`), and an optional `feedConfig` object with properties to customize the created feeds. The function generates the necessary instructions for creating the feeds and sends the transactions to the Solana network.
