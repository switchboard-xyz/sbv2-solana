This code is a set of tests for the "Crank" functionality in the `sbv2-solana` project. The Crank is responsible for managing a queue of aggregator accounts, which are used to collect and aggregate data from various data sources (oracles). The tests ensure that the Crank can create, add, and remove aggregator accounts, as well as handle various edge cases and permissions.

The tests are organized using the Mocha testing framework. The `before` hook sets up the test context, creates a queue authority, and initializes two oracle accounts. The tests then proceed to check the following functionalities:

1. **Creating a Crank**: The test ensures that a new Crank can be created with the specified size and that it is initially empty.

2. **Adding feeds to the Crank**: The test creates a set of aggregator accounts and adds them to the Crank. It checks that the Crank size is as expected and that all aggregator accounts are present in the Crank.

3. **Failing to push a non-permitted aggregator**: The test attempts to add an aggregator account without the required permissions to the Crank and checks that the operation fails with the expected error.

4. **Failing to push a new aggregator onto a full Crank**: The test attempts to add an aggregator account to a full Crank and checks that the operation fails with the expected error.

5. **Crank pop tests**: The test checks the functionality of popping aggregator accounts from the Crank. It waits for some aggregator accounts to be ready, then creates and sends packed transactions to pop the ready accounts. The test checks that the Crank turner is rewarded sufficiently and that at least 50% of the ready accounts are popped.

These tests ensure that the Crank functionality works as expected, allowing the larger project to manage aggregator accounts and handle data aggregation efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `CRANK_SIZE` and `QUEUE_REWARD` constants in the code?
   **Answer:** `CRANK_SIZE` is a constant representing the maximum number of aggregator accounts that can be added to the crank. `QUEUE_REWARD` is a constant representing the reward amount for each aggregator account in the queue, expressed in SOL (the native token of the Solana blockchain).

2. **Question:** How does the `createFeed` and `createFeeds` functions work in the code?
   **Answer:** `createFeed` is a utility function that creates a single aggregator account with the specified parameters, while `createFeeds` is a utility function that creates multiple aggregator accounts in batches. Both functions are used to set up the test environment with the required aggregator accounts.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `it('Crank pop tests', async () => { ... })` test case in the code?
   **Answer:** The 'Crank pop tests' test case is designed to test the functionality of popping aggregator accounts from the crank. It checks whether the correct number of aggregator accounts are popped, if the crank turner is rewarded sufficiently, and if at least 50% of the crank is popped.
