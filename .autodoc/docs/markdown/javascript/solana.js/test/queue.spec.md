This code is a test suite for the queue functionality in the `sbv2-solana` project. It tests various aspects of creating and managing queues and oracles within the project. The tests are written using the Mocha testing framework.

The test suite starts by setting up the test environment using the `setupTest()` utility function. It then proceeds to test the following functionalities:

1. **Creating a Queue**: The test creates a new `QueueAccount` with specified parameters, such as queue size, reward, minimum stake, and oracle timeout. It then loads the data from the created queue account to ensure it was created successfully.

2. **Adding an Oracle to a Queue**: The test adds a new oracle to the created queue by calling the `createOracle()` method on the `queueAccount` object. It then loads the data from the created oracle account and checks if the oracle was added to the queue successfully.

3. **Pushing a Second Oracle onto the Queue**: The test adds another oracle to the queue and checks if it was added successfully.

4. **Failing to Push Oracle #3 - Queue Size Exceeded**: The test attempts to add a third oracle to the queue, which should fail due to the queue size limit. It checks if the appropriate error is thrown.

5. **Depositing into an Oracle Staking Wallet**: The test deposits a specified amount into an oracle's staking wallet and checks if the balance is updated correctly.

6. **Failing to Withdraw if Authority is Missing**: The test attempts to withdraw from an oracle's staking wallet without providing the required authority. It checks if the appropriate error is thrown.

7. **Withdrawing from an Oracle Staking Wallet**: The test withdraws a specified amount from an oracle's staking wallet and checks if the balance is updated correctly.

These tests ensure that the queue and oracle functionalities in the `sbv2-solana` project work as expected, and any changes to the codebase do not introduce unexpected behavior.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `sbv2.QueueAccount` and `sbv2.OracleAccount` classes?**

   The `sbv2.QueueAccount` class represents a queue in the system, with properties like name, metadata, queue size, reward, and more. The `sbv2.OracleAccount` class represents an oracle in the system, with properties like name, metadata, authority, and stake amount.

2. **How does the `heartbeat` function work in the `oracleAccount` instances?**

   The `heartbeat` function is used to update the oracle's status in the queue. It takes an object with properties like `queueAccount`, `tokenWallet`, and `authority`. The function updates the oracle's status in the queue and ensures that it is still active and functioning correctly.

3. **What is the purpose of the `PermissionAccount` class and how is it used in the code?**

   The `PermissionAccount` class represents an account with specific permissions in the system. It is used in the code to create a permission account from a seed, which is then used to load data and perform actions like adding oracles to the queue and managing their staking wallets.
