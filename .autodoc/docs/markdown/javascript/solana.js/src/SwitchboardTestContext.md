The `SwitchboardTestContext` class in this code file is responsible for managing the test environment for the sbv2-solana project. It provides methods to load and initialize the test context, which includes the Switchboard network, wallet, and oracle configurations.

The `load` method attempts to load an existing network using the provided connection and network initialization parameters. If the network does not exist, it creates a new one using the `SwitchboardNetwork.create` method. The method also ensures that the wallet has a non-zero balance and that the oracle authority matches the wallet's public key.

The `loadFromProvider` and `initFromProvider` methods are used to load and initialize the test context using an `AnchorProvider` instance. These methods internally call the `load` method to perform the actual loading and initialization.

The `init` method is used to initialize the test context using a Solana connection, network initialization parameters, wallet path, and program ID. It internally calls the `load` method to perform the actual loading and initialization.

The `findAnchorTomlWallet` function is a utility function that searches for the wallet path in the `Anchor.toml` file. It starts from the current working directory and goes up to three levels, looking for the wallet path in the file.

The `loadKeypair` function is a utility function that loads a keypair from a file path. If the keypair does not exist, it creates a new one.

The `DEFAULT_LOCALNET_NETWORK` object provides default values for initializing the test context, including the queue size, reward, minimum stake, oracle timeout, and other parameters.

Overall, this code file is essential for setting up and managing the test environment for the sbv2-solana project, ensuring that the network, wallet, and oracle configurations are correctly loaded and initialized.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `findAnchorTomlWallet` function and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `findAnchorTomlWallet` function is used to find the wallet path specified in the `Anchor.toml` file. It searches for the wallet path in the current working directory and its parent directories up to 3 levels. If found, it returns the wallet path, otherwise, it throws an error.

2. **Question**: How does the `SwitchboardTestContext.load` function work and what are its parameters?
   **Answer**: The `SwitchboardTestContext.load` function is used to load an existing Switchboard network or create a new one if it doesn't exist. It takes a `Connection`, optional `networkInitParams`, an optional `walletPath`, and an optional `programId` as parameters. It first tries to load an existing network, and if not found, it creates a new network using the provided parameters.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SwitchboardTestContext.init` function and how does it differ from the `SwitchboardTestContext.load` function?
   **Answer**: The `SwitchboardTestContext.init` function is a wrapper around the `SwitchboardTestContext.load` function. It initializes a SwitchboardTestContext instance by loading an existing network or creating a new one. The main difference is that the `init` function also starts the oracle (currently commented out in the code) after loading or creating the network, whereas the `load` function only loads or creates the network.
