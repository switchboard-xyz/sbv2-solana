The `AggregatorJson` class in this code represents an aggregator configuration for the sbv2-solana project. It implements the `CreateQueueFeedParams` interface and is responsible for managing the aggregator's parameters, lease parameters, permission parameters, accounts, and associated jobs.

The constructor of the `AggregatorJson` class takes an object as input and initializes the aggregator's properties using utility functions like `parseString`, `parseNumber`, and `parseBoolean`. These functions help in parsing the input object and setting default values for the properties if they are not provided.

The `loadMultiple` static method is used to load multiple aggregator configurations from a given object. It checks if the object contains an 'aggregators' property and if it is an array. If so, it iterates through the array and creates a new `AggregatorJson` instance for each aggregator configuration, adding them to the `aggregatorJsons` array.

The `toJSON` method returns a JSON representation of the aggregator configuration, which includes all the properties of the aggregator, such as name, metadata, batchSize, and others. It also converts the keypair and authority properties to strings using the `keypairToString` utility function and maps the jobs array to their JSON representations.

In the larger project, the `AggregatorJson` class can be used to manage aggregator configurations, load multiple aggregator configurations from a file or an object, and convert the aggregator configurations to a JSON format for storage or communication purposes.

Example usage:

```javascript
// Load multiple aggregator configurations from an object
const aggregatorConfigs = AggregatorJson.loadMultiple(object);

// Create a new aggregator configuration
const aggregatorConfig = new AggregatorJson({
  name: 'example',
  metadata: 'example metadata',
  batchSize: 5,
});

// Convert the aggregator configuration to JSON
const aggregatorJson = aggregatorConfig.toJSON();
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `AggregatorJson` class and how is it used in the project?**

   The `AggregatorJson` class is used to represent the configuration and parameters for an aggregator in the sbv2-solana project. It implements the `CreateQueueFeedParams` interface and provides methods to load multiple aggregator configurations and convert them to JSON format.

2. **How are the optional parameters in the `AggregatorJson` class handled, and what are their default values?**

   Optional parameters in the `AggregatorJson` class are handled using conditional checks and ternary operators. If a parameter is present in the input object, it is assigned the corresponding value; otherwise, it is assigned a default value or left as `undefined`.

3. **What is the purpose of the `loadMultiple` method in the `AggregatorJson` class, and how does it work?**

   The `loadMultiple` method is used to load multiple aggregator configurations from a given input object. It checks if the input object contains an 'aggregators' property and if it is an array. If so, it iterates through the array and creates a new `AggregatorJson` instance for each aggregator configuration, adding them to an array that is returned at the end.
