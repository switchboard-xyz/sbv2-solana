The `JobJson` class in this code is responsible for managing Oracle jobs in the `sbv2-solana` project. It provides a way to create, load, and serialize Oracle jobs, which are used to perform tasks in the Solana blockchain.

The constructor of the `JobJson` class takes an object as input and initializes the following properties:

- `name`: A string representing the name of the Oracle job.
- `weight`: A number representing the weight of the job, with a default value of 1.
- `expiration`: A number representing the expiration time of the job, with a default value of 0.
- `job`: An instance of the `OracleJob` class, created from the input object.
- `data`: A `Uint8Array` containing the serialized data of the `OracleJob` instance.
- `keypair`: A `Keypair` instance, either loaded from a file or generated.
- `authority`: An optional `Keypair` instance representing the authority of the job, either loaded from a file or left undefined.

The class also provides a static method `loadMultiple`, which takes an object as input and returns an array of `JobJson` instances. This method is useful for loading multiple Oracle jobs at once.

The `toJSON` method returns a JSON representation of the `JobJson` instance, including the name, weight, expiration, keypair, authority, and tasks.

Here's an example of how to create a new `JobJson` instance:

```javascript
const jobDefinition = {
  name: 'exampleJob',
  weight: 2,
  expiration: 60,
  keypair: 'path/to/keypair.json',
  authority: 'path/to/authority.json',
  tasks: [
    // Task definitions go here
  ],
};

const job = new JobJson(jobDefinition);
```

And here's an example of how to load multiple `JobJson` instances:

```javascript
const jobsDefinition = {
  jobs: [
    // Job definitions go here
  ],
};

const jobs = JobJson.loadMultiple(jobsDefinition);
```

Overall, the `JobJson` class is an essential part of the `sbv2-solana` project, as it provides a convenient way to manage Oracle jobs and their associated data.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `JobJson` class?**

   The `JobJson` class is used to represent a job definition in the sbv2-solana project. It includes properties for job parameters, accounts, and methods for constructing the object from a given input, loading multiple job definitions, and converting the object to JSON format.

2. **How are the `keypair` and `authority` properties initialized in the `JobJson` constructor?**

   The `keypair` property is initialized by either loading a keypair from the provided `keypairPath` or generating a new one using `Keypair.generate()`. The `authority` property is initialized by loading a keypair from the provided `authorityPath` or setting it to `undefined` if no path is provided.

3. **What is the purpose of the `loadMultiple` static method in the `JobJson` class?**

   The `loadMultiple` method is used to load multiple job definitions from a given object. It checks if the object contains a 'jobs' property with an array of job definitions, and then creates a new `JobJson` object for each job definition in the array, returning an array of `JobJson` objects.
