The `SwitchboardError` class in this code serves as a wrapper for handling errors in the `sbv2-solana` project. It provides a convenient way to convert numerical error codes into more descriptive error objects based on the program Interface Definition Language (IDL).

The `fromCode` static method is the primary method for converting error codes. It takes a `SwitchboardProgram` object and a numerical error code as input. The method iterates through the errors specified in the program IDL and, if a matching error code is found, creates a new `SwitchboardError` object with the corresponding error information. If no matching error code is found, an error is thrown.

```javascript
const switchboardError = SwitchboardError.fromCode(switchboardProgram, errorCode);
```

The `SwitchboardError` class has four properties:

1. `program`: The `SwitchboardProgram` object containing the program IDL with error codes.
2. `name`: A string representing the name of the error type.
3. `code`: The numerical representation of the error.
4. `msg`: An optional message describing the error in detail.

The constructor for the `SwitchboardError` class is private, ensuring that instances of the class can only be created using the `fromCode` method. This enforces the use of the program IDL for error handling and ensures consistent error objects throughout the project.

In the larger project, the `SwitchboardError` class can be used to handle errors in a more readable and maintainable way. By converting numerical error codes into descriptive error objects, developers can more easily understand and debug issues that arise during the execution of the `sbv2-solana` project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `SwitchboardError` class?**

   The `SwitchboardError` class is a wrapper for handling errors in the Switchboard program. It provides a way to convert numerical error codes to more descriptive error objects based on the program IDL (Interface Definition Language).

2. **How does the `fromCode` static method work?**

   The `fromCode` method takes a `SwitchboardProgram` object and a numerical error code as input. It iterates through the program's IDL errors and returns a new `SwitchboardError` object if a matching error code is found. If no matching error code is found, it throws an error.

3. **What are the properties of the `SwitchboardError` class?**

   The `SwitchboardError` class has four properties: `program`, which is the Switchboard program object containing the IDL; `name`, which is the stringified name of the error type; `code`, which is the numerical representation of the error; and `msg`, which is an optional message describing the error in detail.
