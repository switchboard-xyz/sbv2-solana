This code demonstrates how to create a private Switchboard oracle queue and fulfill an open round request. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Create a new private Switchboard network with a single oracle and crank.
2. Create a new data feed for the queue and crank.
3. Start a new Switchboard oracle and heartbeat on-chain to signal readiness.
4. Call open round on the feed and await the result.

The script begins by importing necessary modules and setting up environment variables. It then defines the `main` function, which performs the following steps:

- Load the payer keypair and determine the cluster and RPC URL.
- Load the Switchboard program using the `SwitchboardProgram.load` method.
- Create a new Switchboard network with the `SwitchboardNetwork.create` method. The network has a single oracle and crank, with no slashing or rewards.
- Create a new data feed for the queue using the `queueAccount.createFeed` method. The feed has a single job with a weight of 2, and uses the OracleJobJson file for its data.
- Start the oracle using the `NodeOracle.fromReleaseChannel` method and wait for it to become ready.
- Call the `openRoundAndAwaitResult` method on the aggregator account to open a new round and await the result.

After the main function is executed, the script stops the oracle and exits the process.

This code can be used as a reference for developers who want to create and manage private Switchboard oracle queues in their projects. The script demonstrates how to set up a private network, create a data feed, start an oracle, and call open round on the feed.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of this script and what are the main steps it performs?
   **Answer:** The purpose of this script is to create a private Switchboard oracle queue and fulfill its own open round request. The main steps it performs are: creating a new private Switchboard network with a single oracle and crank, creating a new data feed for the queue and crank, starting a new Switchboard oracle and sending a heartbeat on-chain to signal readiness, and calling open round on the feed and awaiting the result.

2. **Question:** How does the script determine the payer keypair path and the cluster to use?
   **Answer:** The script first checks if a payer keypair path is provided as a command-line argument, then checks if it's set in the environment variable `PAYER_KEYPAIR`. If neither is provided, it defaults to the path `~/.config/solana/id.json`. For the cluster, it checks if the environment variable `CLUSTER` is set to either "devnet" or "localnet", otherwise it defaults to "devnet".

3. **Question:** How does the script create a new Switchboard network and what are the parameters used for its configuration?
   **Answer:** The script creates a new Switchboard network by calling `SwitchboardNetwork.create()` with the `program` instance and a configuration object. The configuration object includes parameters such as the network name, slashingEnabled flag, reward, minStake, and the configuration for cranks and oracles.
