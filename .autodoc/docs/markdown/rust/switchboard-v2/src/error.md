The code provided is part of the `sbv2-solana` project and defines a custom error type called `SwitchboardError` using the `anchor_lang` library. The purpose of this error type is to handle various error scenarios that may occur within the project, providing clear and concise error messages to help developers understand and debug issues.

`SwitchboardError` is an enumeration that derives the `Eq` and `PartialEq` traits, allowing for easy comparison of error values. Each variant of the enumeration is annotated with a `#[msg]` attribute, which provides a human-readable error message associated with the specific error variant.

The error variants cover a range of issues, such as:

- `InvalidAggregatorRound`: Indicates that the aggregator does not have a valid round populated.
- `InvalidStrDecimalConversion`: Occurs when a string fails to convert to a decimal format.
- `DecimalConversionError`: Represents a failure in the decimal conversion method.
- `IntegerOverflowError`: Indicates an integer overflow occurred during a calculation.
- `AccountDiscriminatorMismatch`: Occurs when the account discriminator does not match the expected value.
- `VrfEmptyError`: Indicates that the VRF value is empty.
- `VrfCpiError`: Represents a failure in sending the `requestRandomness` instruction.
- `VrfCpiSignedError`: Occurs when sending a signed `requestRandomness` instruction fails.
- `AccountDeserializationError`: Represents a failure in deserializing an account.
- `StaleFeed`: Indicates that the Switchboard feed has exceeded the staleness threshold.
- `ConfidenceIntervalExceeded`: Occurs when the Switchboard feed exceeds the confidence interval threshold.
- `InvalidAuthority`: Represents an invalid authority provided to a Switchboard account.
- `AllowedVarianceExceeded`: Indicates that the Switchboard value variance has exceeded the allowed threshold.
- `InvalidFunctionInput`: Occurs when an invalid input is provided to a function.

These error variants can be used throughout the `sbv2-solana` project to handle specific error scenarios and provide meaningful feedback to developers. For example, when implementing a function that requires a valid aggregator round, the `InvalidAggregatorRound` error variant can be returned if the aggregator is not populated with a valid round.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SwitchboardError` enum and how is it used in the code?

   **Answer:** The `SwitchboardError` enum defines a set of custom error codes and their associated error messages for the sbv2-solana project. These errors can be returned by various functions in the code to provide more specific and meaningful error information.

2. **Question:** What is the significance of the `#[error_code]` attribute in the code?

   **Answer:** The `#[error_code]` attribute is used to indicate that the `SwitchboardError` enum should be treated as a custom error code type. This allows the errors to be used with the `Result` type and provides better error handling capabilities.

3. **Question:** How are the `#[msg()]` attributes used in the `SwitchboardError` enum?

   **Answer:** The `#[msg()]` attributes are used to associate human-readable error messages with each variant of the `SwitchboardError` enum. These messages can be displayed when an error occurs, making it easier for developers to understand and debug the issue.
