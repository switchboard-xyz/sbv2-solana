The `SwitchboardDecimal` struct in this code represents a decimal number with a mantissa and a scale. The mantissa is the significant digits of the number, and the scale is the number of decimal places to move to the left to yield the actual value. This struct is used to handle decimal numbers in the `sbv2-solana` project.

The `SwitchboardDecimal` struct provides several methods for creating instances and converting between different numeric types. The `new` method creates a new `SwitchboardDecimal` instance with the given mantissa and scale. The `from_rust_decimal` and `from_f64` methods create instances from `rust_decimal::Decimal` and `f64` types, respectively.

The `TryInto` trait is implemented for `SwitchboardDecimal` to convert it into `Decimal`, `u64`, `i64`, and `f64` types. These conversions can return errors, such as `SwitchboardError::DecimalConversionError` or `SwitchboardError::IntegerOverflowError`, if the conversion is not possible.

The `Ord` and `PartialOrd` traits are implemented for `SwitchboardDecimal` to enable comparison between instances. This allows for sorting and other comparison-based operations.

The `From` trait is implemented for converting a `SwitchboardDecimal` into a `bool`. This conversion is based on whether the rounded mantissa of the decimal is non-zero.

The code also includes tests to ensure the correct behavior of the `SwitchboardDecimal` struct and its methods. These tests cover conversions between different numeric types, comparisons, and other operations.

Example usage:

```rust
let swb_decimal = SwitchboardDecimal::from_f64(1234.5678);
let dec: Decimal = swb_decimal.try_into().unwrap();
assert_eq!(dec.mantissa(), 12345678);
assert_eq!(dec.scale(), 4);
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SwitchboardDecimal` struct and how does it differ from the `Decimal` type provided by the `rust_decimal` crate?
   
   **Answer**: The `SwitchboardDecimal` struct is a custom implementation of a decimal number that represents a floating-point number with a mantissa and a scale. It differs from the `Decimal` type provided by the `rust_decimal` crate in that it is designed to be used specifically within the context of the sbv2-solana project and provides additional conversion methods and implementations for ordering and comparison.

2. **Question**: Why are there two separate implementations of `TryInto<Decimal>` for `SwitchboardDecimal`, one for `&SwitchboardDecimal` and one for `SwitchboardDecimal`?

   **Answer**: There are two separate implementations of `TryInto<Decimal>` for `SwitchboardDecimal` to provide flexibility in converting both borrowed references (`&SwitchboardDecimal`) and owned values (`SwitchboardDecimal`) to the `Decimal` type. This allows developers to choose the appropriate conversion method based on their specific use case and ownership requirements.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `#[zero_copy(unsafe)]` and `#[repr(packed)]` attributes on the `SwitchboardDecimal` struct?

   **Answer**: The `#[zero_copy(unsafe)]` attribute is used to indicate that the `SwitchboardDecimal` struct can be safely used in a zero-copy context, meaning that it can be directly read from or written to memory without requiring any additional copying or serialization. The `#[repr(packed)]` attribute is used to specify that the struct should be packed in memory, meaning that there will be no padding between its fields. This can help reduce memory usage and improve performance in certain scenarios.
