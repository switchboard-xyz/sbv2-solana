This code defines various data structures and their default implementations for the `sbv2-solana` project, which is related to Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) on the Solana blockchain. The primary purpose of these data structures is to facilitate the handling of VRF-related data, such as proofs, points, and scalars, in a zero-copy manner.

The `AccountMetaZC`, `AccountMetaBorsh`, and `CallbackZC` structures are used for handling account metadata and callback information. The `VrfRound` structure represents a VRF round with its associated data, such as the alpha bytes, request slot, request timestamp, result, and the number of builders who verified the VRF proof.

The `VrfStatus` enum represents the various statuses of a VRF account, such as requesting randomness, verifying the proof, and successfully verifying the proof. The `EcvrfProofZC`, `Scalar`, `FieldElement51`, `FieldElementZC`, `CompletedPoint`, `EdwardsPoint`, `ProjectivePoint`, and `EcvrfIntermediate` structures are used for handling various cryptographic elements, such as points, scalars, and intermediate values in the VRF proof generation and verification process.

The `VrfBuilder` structure is the main structure used for building and verifying VRF proofs. It contains fields for the producer's public key, the current status of the VRF verification, the VRF proof, intermediate values, and the result of the verification.

These data structures are essential for the `sbv2-solana` project, as they enable efficient handling of VRF-related data and facilitate the process of generating and verifying VRF proofs on the Solana blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `#[zero_copy(unsafe)]` attribute used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `#[zero_copy(unsafe)]` attribute is used to indicate that the struct can be safely cast to a byte slice without any additional serialization or deserialization. This allows for more efficient data handling, as it avoids the overhead of serialization and deserialization.

2. **Question**: How does the `VrfStatus` enum represent the different stages of the VRF verification process?
   **Answer**: The `VrfStatus` enum represents the different stages of the VRF verification process by defining variants for each stage, such as `StatusNone`, `StatusRequesting`, `StatusVerifying`, `StatusVerified`, `StatusCallbackSuccess`, and `StatusVerifyFailure`. Each variant corresponds to a specific stage in the process.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Default` trait implementations for structs like `CallbackZC`, `VrfRound`, and `VrfBuilder`?
   **Answer**: The `Default` trait implementations for these structs provide a way to create a new instance of the struct with all its fields set to their default values (usually zero or an empty state). This is useful when initializing a new instance of the struct without having to explicitly set each field value.
