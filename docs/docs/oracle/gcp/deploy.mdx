## Build Helm Charts

After completing the steps in the previous pages, you should have a `PROJECTNAME.env` file with each of the required variables defined. See [Google Cloud / Environment](./env) for a list of all required variables that must be set.

Run the following command to build the helm charts with your environment variables injected into the manifests:

```bash
./build-helm.sh PROJECTNAME
```

## Deploy Helm Charts

Run the command

```bash
./deploy-helm.sh PROJECTNAME
```

When complete, you should see your cluster running in the Google Cloud Console.

## Update

If necessary, rebuild the charts to update any environment variables:

```bash
./build-helm.sh PROJECTNAME
```

then redeploy the helm charts:

```bash
./deploy-helm.sh PROJECTNAME
```
