# Queue

An oracle queue is responsible for managing a set of oracles and how they get allocated to aggregator update request. Oracles are arranged in a round-robin fashion, where once requested, the next N oracles in the queue are assigned to a feed. Oracle positions are periodically swapped to mitigate oracles being assigned to the same feeds each update cycle.
