A permission account is a program derived address between a granter and grantee public key, and dictates whether the grantee has permissions to use an on-chain resource from a granter.

An oracle queue manages how its resources get allocated by using permission accounts. Any oracle or aggregator that wants to use a feed must be approved by the queue's authority. The Switchboard DAO oracle queue's will use on-chain voting to control how permission accounts are created and revoked.
