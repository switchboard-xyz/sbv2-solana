A permission account is a program derived address between a granter and grantee public key, and dictates whether the grantee has permissions to use an on-chain resource from a granter.

An oracle queue manages how its resources get allocated by using permission accounts. Any oracle or aggregator that wants to use a feed must be approved by the queue's authority. The Switchboard DAO oracle queue's will use on-chain voting to control how permission accounts are created and revoked.

## Queue Configuration

Oracles **_always_** need `PERMIT_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT` permissions before joining a queue.

### ‚öôÔ∏èunpermissionedFeedsEnabled

If a queue has `unpermissionedFeedsEnabled`, then new Aggregators will not need to be granted permissions by the queue authority to request a new result. The Aggregator still needs to create a permission account between itself and the oracle queue.

### ‚öôÔ∏èunpermissionedVrfEnabled

If a queue has `unpermissionedVrfEnabled`, then new VRF accounts will not need to be granted permissions by the queue authority to request a new randomness result. The VRF account still needs to create a permission account between itself and the oracle queue.

## Functions

A permission account is responsible for the following functions:

- [**Access Control**](#provide-minStake): Control access to a queue's resources.

### üöÄAccess Control

Oracle queue's use permission accounts to manage access to its oracles and cranks. A permission account is a program derived address between a granter and grantee public key, and dictates whether the grantee has permissions to use an on-chain resource from a granter. In this case, its the oracle queue granting the following permissions:

<SwitchboardPermission />

An oracle queue `authority` can change a resources permissions using the PermissionSet instruction.
