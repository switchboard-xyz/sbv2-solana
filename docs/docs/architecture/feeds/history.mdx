A history buffer account stores a set number of accepted results for an aggregator, and given Solanaâ€™s maximum account size of 10MB, the maximum number of samples a single history buffer can support is 350,000 samples. An aggregator can only have a single history buffer associated with it. This feature allows Switchboard task to parse a history buffer for its calculations, such as the TwapTask.

## Functions

A history buffer account is responsible for the following functions:

- [Historical Data](#historical-data): Define the number of historical samples to store.

### ðŸš€Historical Data

A history buffer has a static account size when it is initialized, equal to: `12 Bytes + (28 Bytes Ã— Num Samples)`. Each time an aggregator value is updated on-chain, the associated history buffer is shifted to the right, and the last value is dropped.

## Account Schema
